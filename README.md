## Reflections

This project was both continuing practice for object oriented programming, and an opportunity to learn and implement file I/O and serialisation.
Both the file management and serialisation aspects were easier than I originally anticipated but did require some thinking of where to place so that only relevant data was getting saved / written to file.

The biggest hurdle for this one was mental rather than the coding aspect. I got somewhat blocked for a couple of weeks and put off working on this project. The key to breaking that blockage was focusing on splitting up tasks into the smallest units possible in order to build enthusiasm and momentum. This had the added bonus of forcing me to make smaller and more modular commits; a habit I've been meaning to implement for some time. 

Ultimately an enjoyable project despite the initial blockage. 

The key takeaway is to try and take that approach of dividing projects into tiny chunks and apply it much more rigorously and consistently.
